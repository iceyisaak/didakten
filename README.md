# didakten
## What
Die Didakten (the didacts) is a initiative of autodidacts in technology in Frankfurt am Main, germany. We want to make what we teached ourselves more sustainable by teaching non-autodidacts (=xenodidacts), e.g. in form of conventional classroom trainings of web technologies (HTML/CSS/Javascript) using open source software.
## Language
So far nobody translated our materials, that's why everything is in german.
